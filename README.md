## Introduction

playform aspires to be an open-world sandbox game written in Rust.
Right now, it just renders a basic world and stops the player from colliding
with it.

It can be built with `cargo build`, which should grab dependencies
automatically. `playform` can then be run from the `target` directory.

The camera can be moved using `WASD` controls, as well as `Space` and `LShift`,
and it can be rotated using the arrow keys.
