playform aspires to be an open-world sandbox game written in Rust.

It is currently little more than an experiment in 3D graphics.

It can be built with `cargo build`, which should grab dependencies
automatically.

`playform` can then be run from the `target` directory.

The camera can be moved using `WASD` controls, and rotated using the arrow keys.
